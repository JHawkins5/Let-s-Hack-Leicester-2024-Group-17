    <p>Honest reviews from real students</p>
    <p>Accom review is a website created by students for students with the sole purpose of improving transparency in the student accommodation market.</p>
    <p>Often, we find that accommodation reviews are fake, biased, or not easily accessible. Accom Review sets out to solve this problem by providing student residents with a platform to voice their opinions in a clean and fair manner.</p>
